# Changelog

All notable changes to Local AI Workspace are documented here.

## [0.1.6-project-health-dashboard] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added a sanitized `/health/summary` endpoint for portfolio-friendly project health reporting.
- Added a Project Health Dashboard in Settings with cards for server, version, model, memory, RAG, web search, audit log, tests, release readiness, storage, and privacy.
- Added an Advanced raw system status section so detailed diagnostics stay separate from the normal dashboard.

### Changed

- Normal health dashboard output hides local filesystem paths and reports configured storage paths as status fields instead.
- Health summary uses lightweight checks and avoids loading heavy semantic-memory dependencies.

### Testing

- Local test status: `161 passed`.
- Total coverage: `85%`.

## [0.1.5-recipe-search-routing] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- Added automatic web-search routing for recipe and practical instruction questions, including prompts such as `Hae pullataikinan ohje`.
- Added regression tests to prevent recipe/instruction prompts from falling through to unrelated model answers such as Git pull instructions.

### Testing

- Local test status: `161 passed`.
- Total coverage: `85%`.

## [0.1.4-automatic-factual-search] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- Added automatic web-search routing for broad factual questions, including product/specification questions such as fuel consumption, model data, prices, weights, dimensions, manuals, and technical details.
- Added model-provider fallback behavior: if the local model returns an empty/502 response, chat can fall back to web search instead of showing a raw provider error to the user.
- Added tests for Volvo Penta 2003T style factual questions through both the tool router and the full `/chat` endpoint.

### Changed

- Web search status now reports automatic search as enabled.
- Chat no longer relies only on narrow weather/lottery/current-info detection before using search.

### Testing

- Local test status: `159 passed`.
- Total coverage: `85%`.

## [0.1.3-coverage-lift] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Added targeted coverage tests for API routes, memory endpoints, tool file operations, config updates, Ollama status handling, and chat routing fallbacks.
- Added tool-router command coverage for common user-facing commands, file operations, semantic search, preview routing, and guarded error paths.
- Added live eval runner tests for passing model responses and provider-error handling.
- Added RAG quality gate tests for passing, empty-result, weak-score, low-coverage, and missing-ranking-reason cases.

### Testing

- Local test status: `156 passed`.
- Total coverage: `85%`.
- Key coverage improvements:
  - `app/main.py`: `77%` -> `84%`.
  - `app/tool_router.py`: `69%` -> `77%`.
  - `app/live_evals.py`: `29%` -> `100%`.
  - `app/rag_quality.py`: `70%` -> `100%`.

## [0.1.2-reliability-hardening] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Added targeted reliability tests for the highest-risk AI integration paths:
  - RAG retrieval ranking, source filtering, strict document intent, chat-log exclusion, and curated upload selection.
  - Web search provider failures, Google/Brave provider parsing, cache behavior, source review, and weather-source summarization.
  - Ollama/model provider response handling, unknown provider rejection, and connection-error wrapping.
  - Tool-router routing for guarded file tools, semantic search, status/log routes, and tool-error handling.

### Testing

- Local test status: `125 passed`.
- Total coverage: `71%`.
- Key coverage improvements:
  - `app/rag_engine.py`: `52%` -> `80%`.
  - `app/web_search.py`: `61%` -> `81%`.
  - `app/model_provider.py`: `72%` -> `95%`.
  - `app/tool_router.py`: `47%` -> `69%`.
