# Local AI Workspace

[![Tests](https://github.com/denzo69/sade-v1-local/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/denzo69/sade-v1-local/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Local AI Workspace is a local-first AI assistant project demonstrating modern AI engineering practices: FastAPI, local LLM integration, memory, retrieval, testing, security, and maintainable architecture.

It is designed as a portfolio-grade AI engineering project: it demonstrates not only model interaction, but also testability, memory governance, tool permissions, prompt-injection awareness, authentication, and release hygiene.

## What this project demonstrates

- Building a local AI assistant with FastAPI and a browser UI.
- Designing memory and RAG workflows with explicit truth boundaries.
- Separating user-facing features from advanced developer tools.
- Implementing authentication, CSRF protection, audit logging, and backup workflows.
- Adding AI evals, prompt-injection checks, tool risk policies, and release readiness checks.
- Writing a portfolio-friendly open-source project surface: README, QUICKSTART, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, CI, issue templates, and changelog.

## Engineering skills demonstrated

Local AI Workspace demonstrates practical AI engineering rather than only prompt experimentation:

- local AI application architecture with FastAPI;
- authentication, CSRF protection, audit logging, and guarded file tools;
- RAG, semantic memory, web-search truth boundaries, and AI eval entrypoints;
- test-driven hardening with `pytest`, coverage reports, and release readiness checks;
- portfolio-quality documentation and a maintainable GitHub project surface.

## Highlights

- **Local-first AI workspace** using Ollama through a model provider layer.
- **Chat, memory, sources, and settings** as the user-facing UI.
- **Finnish/English UI language switch** (`fi` / `en`).
- **Memory governance**: list memories, export memory, guarded deletion API.
- **RAG and source quality checks** for safer retrieval-assisted answers.
- **Prompt injection detection** and tool risk classification.
- **Audit log and debug trace** for safety and observability.
- **Authentication** with local users, CSRF protection, and session cookies.
- **Static and live AI eval entrypoints**.
- **Backup/restore workflow** for local data.
- **GitHub Actions CI** with pytest and coverage reporting.

## Screenshots

The interface is browser-based and can be accessed from both desktop and mobile devices over a trusted local network or secure remote connection.

The same Local AI Workspace runs as one local AI service and can be opened from multiple devices:

**Desktop browser view on the local workstation**

## Quickstart

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/denzo69/sade-v1-local.git
cd sade-v1-local
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\app\create_sade_user.bat
.\app\restart_local_ai_workspace.bat
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/ui
```

More detail: [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)

## Tests

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

Current local status:

```text
159 passed locally
coverage: 85% total, with targeted hardening around RAG, web search, automatic factual search, model provider fallback, tool routing, API routes, and live eval entrypoints
GitHub Actions: passing
```

Coverage locally:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install pytest-cov
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest --cov=app --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
```

Release readiness:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\release_readiness.py
```

## Demo path

Try these in order:

1. Open the UI and send a chat message.
2. Add a memory in **Memory**.
3. Upload a document in **Sources**.
4. Search from sources in advanced tools.
5. Run static evals.
6. Create a backup archive.
7. Check audit status.

## Web search providers

Web search is provider-based. By default, the app uses `SADE_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=auto`:

1. Google Programmable Search if `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` are configured.
2. Brave Search if `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` is configured.
3. DuckDuckGo Lite as a no-key best-effort fallback.

Supported values:

```text
SADE_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=auto
SADE_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=duckduckgo
SADE_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=brave
SADE_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=google
```

Bing is documented as a future Azure AI Foundry / Grounding with Bing integration rather than using the retired legacy Bing Search APIs.

## Key routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/ui` | Browser UI |
| `/chat` | Chat endpoint |
| `/auth/status` | Authentication status |
| `/memory/entries` | List memory entries |
| `/memory/export` | Export memory |
| `/backup/archive` | Create zip backup |
| `/rag/search` | Source-aware retrieval |
| `/rag/quality` | RAG quality gate |
| `/tools/policies` | Tool risk policies |
| `/evals/static` | Static AI evals |
| `/evals/live` | Optional live model evals |
| `/debug/trace` | Developer trace |

## Safety model

Local AI Workspace is intended for local or trusted-network use. Do not expose it directly to the public internet.

Safety principles:

- Web results are sources, not automatic truth.
- Personal memory is not committed to Git.
- High-risk tool actions are audited.
- Developer tools are behind advanced settings.
- Secrets, sessions, vector DBs, uploads, and backups are excluded from the public repo.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Project status

Local AI Workspace is a portfolio-stage AI assistant project. It is not a commercial SaaS product and should not be treated as production-ready infrastructure without additional hardening, deployment review, and operational monitoring.
